🖥️ Admin Dashboard
This project was built as part of The Odin Project curriculum to practice using CSS Grid. The entire layout of the admin dashboard is structured with grid, including sidebar, header, main content area, and footer.

In addition to CSS Grid, I used other techniques learned in earlier sections of the course, such as:

• flexbox for layout alignment
• custom checkboxes with accent-color
• input styling
• hover effects
• responsive element positioning

🎯 Features
• Fully structured admin dashboard layout using CSS Grid
• Emoji-based navigation with consistent spacing using flexbox
• Search bar with rounded input
• Profile section with image and name
• Display of projects as preview thumbnails linking to live demos
• Embedded video from my personal Instagram
• Custom task list using styled checkboxes
• Themed buttons with hover interactions
• Multicolored, segmented background with sharp color stops (no gradient blending)
